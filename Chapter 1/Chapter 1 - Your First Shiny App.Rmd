# Chapter 1: Your First Shiny App

## Intro

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
packageVersion("shiny") #this is to check Shiny app version
library(shiny)
```

## Create App Directory and File

-   Usually, we create a app.R file and work in there.

-   To add the boilerplate, use the snippet "shinyapp" or using a new project shiny app template from menu

## Running and Stopping

-   You can take the url from "Listening" and open it in a web browser.

-   While Shiny is running, you cannot use R.

-   If you edit the app code, you don't need to stop it and rerun it again. You can use the "Reload app" button or Ctrl Shift Enter
